   6. FINAL VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
      - Double-check that any content about a physical location is categorized as "Place"
      - Ensure all place-related videos (travel, tourism, landmarks, attractions) are categorized as "Place"
      - Confirm that all information is either from the transcript or verified through search
      - Verify that NULL is used for missing information (NOT text like "Not available")
   
   7. ADDRESS SEARCH INSTRUCTIONS - YOUR MOST IMPORTANT TASK:
      - For Place and Restaurant types, finding the EXACT ADDRESS is your PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY
      - DO NOT return "Not available" for address - you MUST search the web extensively
      - Follow these steps precisely:
        1. First, identify the exact name of the place/restaurant
        2. Search for "[place name] address" and "[place name] [location] address"
        3. Look for official websites, Google Maps listings, TripAdvisor, Yelp, or other reliable sources
        4. The address MUST include street name, building number (if applicable), city, and country
        5. If the first search doesn't yield results, try alternative search queries
        6. For tourist attractions, landmarks, or parks, search for their official addresses
        7. For restaurants, search for their exact location including street address
        8. ONLY if after multiple search attempts you cannot find ANY address information, then use null
      - NEVER use placeholder text like "Not available" or "Address not found" - either provide a real address or null

   6. LOCATION NAME IDENTIFICATION RULES:
      - ALWAYS prioritize the island, major city, or region name over specific neighborhoods/areas
      - For beach/resort areas, use the island or main region name (e.g., "Tenerife" not "Costa Adeje")
      - For attractions within cities, use the city name only (e.g., "Rome" not "Vatican City")
      - For national parks or natural areas, use the region name (e.g., "Yosemite" or "California")
      - ONLY provide a single name - never include multiple names, regions, or countries
      - If in doubt, choose the more widely recognized location name that people would search for
   
   7. FINAL VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
      - Double-check that any content about a physical location is categorized as "Place"
      - Ensure all place-related videos (travel, tourism, landmarks, attractions) are categorized as "Place"
      - Confirm that all information is either from the transcript or verified through search
      - VERIFY that the Location field contains ONLY the primary location name (region/island/major city)
      - VERIFY your detected content type appears correctly in the summary (e.g., if type is "Place", summary should have "Place": [...])
      - Verify that NULL is used for missing information (NOT text like "Not available")
   
   8. ADDRESS SEARCH INSTRUCTIONS - YOUR MOST IMPORTANT TASK:
      - For Place and Restaurant types, finding the EXACT ADDRESS is your PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY
      - DO NOT return "Not available" for address - you MUST search the web extensively
      - Follow these steps precisely:
        1. First, identify the exact name of the place/restaurant
        2. Search for "[place name] address" and "[place name] [location] address"
        3. Look for official websites, Google Maps listings, TripAdvisor, Yelp, or other reliable sources
        4. The address MUST include street name, building number (if applicable), city, and country
        5. If the first search doesn't yield results, try alternative search queries
        6. For tourist attractions, landmarks, or parks, search for their official addresses
        7. For restaurants, search for their exact location including street address
        8. ONLY if after multiple search attempts you cannot find ANY address information, then use null
      - NEVER use placeholder text like "Not available" or "Address not found" - either provide a real address or null
   
   IMPORTANT: In your JSON response, use your detected content type (Place, Restaurant, etc.) as the key in the summary, NOT "ContentType".
   
   Provide your analysis in this exact JSON format:
   {
     "type": "Place, Restaurant, Software, Film/Show, etc.",
     "title": "clear and descriptive title",
     "summary": {
       "Place": [
         {
           "Name": "value",
           "Location": "primary location",
           "Highlights": ["item1", "item2"],
           ...
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   
   DO NOT include any explanations or additional text outside the JSON object.
